Description: The Kaya Identity is an equation that expresses yearly CO2 emissions as a product of four factors:
  Population size (in millions)
  GDP per capita (in 1000$/person)
  Energy intensity (in Gigajoule/$1000GDP). Energy intensity is the energy needed to produce a certain
  amount of economic value.
  Carbon intensity (in tonnes CO2/Gigajoule). Carbon intensity is the CO2 emitted for produced energy.
  This number depends on the energy mix used (coal, solar, . . . ).
